Leetcode Question 1218 
Longest Arithemtic Subsequence Of Given Difference

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/description/


Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elemetns in the subsequence equals difference.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from arr by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.

Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].


Solution / Intuition /Algorithm

The first thing that comes to the find is to find all the subsequences and check for the condition that the difference is  remains same in the entire subsequence , but there can be 2^n subsequences , so this is not the optimized solution .

Or what we can do is traverse the entire array and select every number as starting number and then check whether a number with starting number +difference exists ... now for the next time we check whether starting number +2*difference exists or implement this logic in some other manner .


The total number of such numbers is our required solution . The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) . Implemented this solution in the leetcode but it is giving me time limit exceeded error.
This signifies , either this question can be solved in O(n) or in O(nlogn)...

So, we can actually find the solution in O(n) time.


The idea is that if we assume that this is the number of AP subsequence , how many numbers occured before it  . We maintain a dictionary that stores , how many numbers are before a given number that can be considered as the subsequence part. Now we tranverse the array and maintain the dictionary .If any (number - difference) we increase the subsequence count. Also, we would be storing the maxCount as well
